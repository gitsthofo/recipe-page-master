    <h2>Instructions</h2>

    <p class="last-p"><span class="material-symbols-outlined instruction">
        looks_one
        </span>Adjust the oven rack to the lower-middle position and preheat oven to 350°F (177°C).</p>



        <p class="last-p"><span class="material-symbols-outlined instruction">looks_two</span>

            Make the filling: Using a handheld or stand mixer fitted with a paddle attachment,
             beat the cream cheese and granulated sugar together on medium-high speed in a large
              bowl until the mixture is smooth and creamy, about 2 minutes. Add the sour cream, vanilla extract,
               and lemon juice then beat until fully combined. On medium speed, add the eggs one at a time,
                beating after each addition until just blended. After the final egg is incorporated into the batter,
                 stop mixing. To help prevent the cheesecake from deflating and cracking as it cools,
             avoid over-mixing the batter as best you can.
            </p>

                <span class="material-symbols-outlined instruction">looks_4</span>

                Prepare the simple water bath (see note) Boil a pot of water. 
                You need 1 inch of water in your roasting pan for the water bath, 
                so make sure you boil enough. I use an entire kettle of hot water.
                 As the water is heating up, wrap the aluminum foil around the springform pan. Pour the cheesecake batter on top of the crust. Use a rubber spatula or spoon to smooth it into an even layer. Place the pan inside of a large roasting pan. Carefully pour the hot water inside of the pan and place in the oven. (Or you can place the roasting pan in the oven first, 
                then pour the hot water in. Whichever is easier for you.)
            </p>

            <p class="last-p"><span class="material-symbols-outlined instruction">looks_5</span>
                Bake cheesecake for 55-70 minutes or until the center is almost set.
                 When it’s done, the center of the cheesecake will slightly wobble if you gently shake the pan. Turn the oven off and open the oven door slightly. Let the cheesecake sit in the oven in the water bath as it cools down for 1 hour. Remove from the oven and water bath, then cool cheesecake completely at room temperature.
                 Then refrigerate the cheesecake for at least 4 hours or overnight.
            </p>

            <p class="last-p"><span class="material-symbols-outlined instruction">looks_6</span>
                Use a knife to loosen the chilled cheesecake from the rim of the springform pan,
                 then remove the rim. Using a clean sharp knife, cut into slices for serving. For neat slices,
                 wipe the knife clean and dip into warm water between each slice.
            </p>

            <p class="last-p"><span class="material-symbols-outlined instruction">looks_6</span>Serve cheesecake with desired toppings. 
                Cover and store leftover cheesecake in the refrigerator for up to 5 days.</p>
